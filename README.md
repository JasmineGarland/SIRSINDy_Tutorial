## Welcome to our APPM 4720-5720 Code Tutorial!

Today we will walk through a code tutorial investigating an SIR model for Measles, Chickenpox, and Rubella in Ortario, as discussed in <em>Algorithmic discovery of dynamic models from infectious disease data. <em>

### Suggested Exercises
   
```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

- Recall that the paper used ```math
SE = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
``` S_0 = 0.11286 and $\lambda$ = 0.00517, provided in code file x in line y. Change these values and observe the difference.
