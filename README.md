## Welcome to our APPM 4720-5720 Code Tutorial!

Today we will walk through a code tutorial investigating an SIR model along with a continuous and discrete SINDy model. Please download the code at [put link here] which will contain six .m files. 

The poolData scripts may seem familar from a previous class, however we modified the script to include the seasonal term:
   
 ![Image](/SIRSINDy_Tutorial/docs/assets/Picture1.png)
  
used in <em> Algorithmic discovery of dynamic models from infectious disease data. <em>
   
Note: remember this when you see oscillations in the plots!

The two main files we will work on today are 'main_sirmodel_continuous.m' and 'main_sirmodel_discrete.m' as there names suggest one file contains the continuous model while the other contains the discrete model.

### Learning Objectives
  

```markdown
#### Today our goal is for you to learn:

- Differences in discreate and continous SINDy.
- Sensitivity of inital conditions. 
- Effects of changing the sparsity knob.
- How key parameters such as birthrate and how long an individual is for, impact the overall results.
- The impacts of noise on the data.
```

To achieve the learning objectives we have prepared the exercises below.
  
### Suggested Exercises
   
```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

**Exercise One**
   1. Fix lambda to 0.005 (in line x)
   2. With the fixed lambda run the initial condition (SO in line x) as 5E-05
   3. With the fixed lambda comment out SO and active the SOvec (in line x), notice how slightly larger and smaller values impact the model.

**Exercise Two**
   1. Deactivate SOvec and change SO to be fixed at 5E-05
   2. Deactivate lambda (in line x)
   3. Activate lambdavec, notice how sparsity impacts the model
 
**Exercise Three**
   1. Deactive lambdavec and set lambda back to 0.005 (line x)
   2. In line x and x uncomment the noise parameter to add noise to the data, how does this impact the results?
   
**Exercise Four**
   1. Comment the noise parameters back out in line x and x. 
   2. In line x change g from 1/5 to 1/10 (infectious for 10 days rather than 5), how does this change the graphs and what does this mean?
   3. Change g back to 1/5 and change mu (the birthrate in line x) from 8E-04 to 8E-03 and then 9E-05, what do you see?
