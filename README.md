## Welcome to our APPM 4720-5720 Code Tutorial!

Today we will walk through a code tutorial investigating an SIR and SINDy model for Measles, Chickenpox, and Rubella in Ortario, as discussed in <em>Algorithmic discovery of dynamic models from infectious disease data. <em>

**If you need a refresher of todays presentation please follow this [link!](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GRg98F1XywcRTaKcQUPaYT0xAZytR4CvTtMcDWtW5C8/edit?usp=sharing) You may also find the publication [here.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-63877-w)**

  
  
  Today we walk through two scripts, one for discrete SINDy and one for continuous SINDy. The poolData script may seem familar from a previous class, however we modified the script to include the seasonal term

### Learning Objectives
  

```markdown
Today our goal is for you to learn:

- Differences in discreate and continous SINDy.
- Sensitivity of inital conditions. 
- Effects of changing the sparsity knob.
- How key parameters such as birthrate and how long an individual is for, impact the overall results.

- Recall that the paper used $$S_{0} = 0.11286$$ and $$\lambda$$ = 0.00517$$, provided in code file x in line y. Change these values and observe the difference.
